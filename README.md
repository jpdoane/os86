# os86
baremetal sandbox for rudimentary os development

Not much here yet other than a basic bootloader (borrwoed from osdev.org) and some simple terminal printing functionality.  Main contribution so far is a porting of printf()

To compile and run, you will need to set up qemu and a cross-platform 32bit x86 toolchain, per instructions on osdev.org
